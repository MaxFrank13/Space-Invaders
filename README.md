# Space-Invaders

## Description

I built a Gameboy in Blender and then imported it using threeJS. Pressing the start button triggers an animation that zooms in on the Gameboy and then displays an interface representing the screen. Another UI appears and when you press start a Space Invaders game is rendered to the page.
